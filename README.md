# epistemologica

Epistemelogica is a project that seeks to recover, valorize and interpret historical text analysis in the humanities. This is a project by St√©fan Sinclair & Geoffrey Rockwell.

The following notebooks are a bit more developed, though not yet complete:

* [T. C. Mendenhall's "The Characteristic Curves of Composition"](Mendenhall-CharacteristicCurve.ipynb)
* [John B. Smith's "Image and Imagery in Joyce's _Portrait_](Smith-Imagery.ipynb)
* Paul Fortier's "Some Statistics of Themes in the French Novel"
